Serial Controlled OLED Display
==============================

Two programs in one!

  1) Arduino code to read commands from a serial port and update an
     OLED display.

  2) A Haskell program to display various bits of information on that
     OLED display via the serial port.

Mostly I'm going to use this to display a Pomodoro timer.
